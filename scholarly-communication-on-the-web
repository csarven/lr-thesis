              <p>I invite the reader to consider two conceptions that describe the effects of technological mediums on society and its similarities with the evolution of scientific paradigms. This will serve as the historical framing for this thesis and the realisation of a range of effects and artefacts by applying the methods and values that are native to the Web.</p>

              <blockquote cite="urn:isbn:9780262633178">
                <p>Gutenberg had, in effect, made every man a reader. Today, Xerox and other forms of reprography tend to make every man a publisher. This massive reversal has, for one of its consequences, elitism. The nature of the mass production of uniform volumes certainly did not foster elites but rather habits of universal reading. Paradoxically, when there are many readers, the author can wield great private power, whereas small reading elites may exert large corporate power.</p>

              </blockquote>

              <p>In the 1962 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/993539009" rel="schema:url">The Gutenberg Galaxy</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> explains how the adoption of new technological mediums shifted human culture in Europe through four eras, with emphasis placed on extending our senses:</p>

              <ol type="lower-roman">
                <li>acoustic age (c. until 800 BCE); audile-tactile, preliterate tribal culture,</li>
                <li>age of writing (c. 800 BCE to 1500 CE); audile/visual, manuscript culture,</li>
                <li>age of print (c. 1500 to 1850 CE); visual, mechanical mass communication,</li>
                <li>age of electronic media (c. 1850 CE to present); central nervous system, <q>global village</q></li>
              </ol>

              <p id="acoustic-age">According to McLuhan, the acoustic world depended on speech and hearing for communication. Information was an instantaneous and simultaneous experience for speakers and listeners with a collective identity. Existence was about narrated events and survived through story-telling, songs, and poems.</p>

              <p id="writing-age">When the phonetic alphabet came along, information could be defined, classified, and referenced, as well as better preserved. The written word made human knowledge tangiable, stretching itself across time and space. While the written word increased the need of our visual system, it brought along the acoustic world with it - early reading was still an oral, and by and large an external (social) activity, as opposed to internal in one's mind.</p>

              <p id="print-age">Through the age of writing to the age of print, the phonetic alphabet transformed from being an audile-tactile experience to purely visual. Gutenberg's printing press (c. 1439 CE), through the process of mechanical mass production, had an extensive impact on the circulation of information, and triggered reconfiguration of societies' structures. Books have boundaries, uniformity, continuity, linearity, and repeatability; this had a profound influence on the way social systems were organised. Print further "detribalised" social organisations, enabling individualism, fragmentation, government centralism, and nationalism. As a work was mechanically copied, it maintained its consistency and accuracy in comparison to hand copied manuscripts. It was easier to transmit information without personal contact. Then came the responsibility for authors to be consistent with their definitive statements. Once a piece of knowledge was publicly shared, its creator was identifiable and received recognition [<cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174040346">Connections</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29">Burke</a> (1978)]. Print media democratised knowledge as soon as it became a commodity, mass produced and distributed to populations. The general public had a reason to not only access or acquire media like books, but also had a reason to learn to read for themselves, where previously it was necessary to go through a third-party; the wealthy, scholar, or theologian, in order to be informed. The increase in literacy consequently helped the public to be better knowledgeable about world matters without being subject to official or unofficial censorship. As there were more readers, the ability to write fostered the formulation and preservation of individual thought and culture, as well as enabling the public to voice themselves and question authority. The print media also played a key role in facilitating scientific publishing and the scientific revolution [<cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611804138">The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eisenstein">Eisenstein</a> (1979)].</p>

              <p id="electronic-age">The electric <em>mass</em>-age made it possible to have instantaneous communication in different forms across the globe. Electronic media did not have the same kinds of boundaries that the print had on society and how it re-organised itself. Unlike print media, electronic media like telephone, radio, and television, did not require literacy, and consequently the support of a stable education system. As a whole, it had the same effects on society as the acoustic space created in the tribal world. The speed of information increased, and with it retrieved sociality and involvement which was previously abandoned as the primary mode of information exchange. Perhaps more interestingly, as the flow of information through various electronic media accelerated, it facilitated our natural tendency to recognise patterns and (ir)regularities in data - in comparison to print media which happened to isolate, classify, and immobilise items.</p>

              <p>Later we will revisit McLuhan's studies on the psychic and social consequences of technological innovation and apply them to scholarly communication on the Web. For some of the effects and artefacts of media, I analyse their core characteristics, and use this as a framework for understanding the impact of evolving media technology like the Web on modern scholarly communication.</p>

              <p>Next, to continue to paint the historical backdrop against which this thesis is placed, I look at the European-centric scientific revolution which overlapped with the transition from the manuscript to the print-centric mode of information organisation and dissemination.</p>

Kuhn, 1973</footer>
              </blockquote>

              <p>In <cite>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite>, Thomas S. Kuhn proposes an explanation for the process of discovery and progress in the history and philosophy of science. Kuhn contended that science did not progress linearly through history, rather it starts with a period that's disorganised, and then a paradigm - a collection of <em>exemplar</em> agreed by scientists on how problems are to be understood - develops to organise things for day-to-day <q>normal science</q> to take place under the governed paradigm. After some time, <q>anomalies</q> in the paradigm accumulate and lead to a <q>crisis</q> phase where multiple competing paradigms attempt to resolve the issues. This is a particular point in which the community struggles to come to an agreement on the fittest way to practice future science. Finally a <q>paradigm shift</q> - revolution - refers to the last phase where transforming ideas and assertions mature enough to bring order to earlier anomalies, and cause a change in world view. Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was about the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with the world in favour of more fruitful. Progress was not a mere line leading to truth.</p>

              <p>As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists' decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms - the ideas and assertions within - were not necessarily directly comparable. For example, early versions of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus in <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus">Commentariolus</a></cite> (1514), as well as the matured version in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium">De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></cite> (1543) was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy's <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">geocentric model</a></cite> (c. 2nd century CE) based on the knowledge and instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was regarded to be more consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus' case however offered a simpler explanation and broader scope of application. These were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton's laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research.</p>

              <p>Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton's theory of gravity and Einstein's relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens towards understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein's theory was still able to precisely predict Newton's theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

              <p>Later on I will describe the paradigm in which scientific and scholarly communication is currently situated, and investigate the emerging alternative paradigm that better integrates with the Web. In order to understand the conceptual frameworks and their adequacy, we will use Kuhn's five characteristics; <q cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20180619083836/https://iweb.langara.bc.ca/rjohns/files/2018/03/Kuhn_theory_choice.pdf">accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness</q> from <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180619083836/https://iweb.langara.bc.ca/rjohns/files/2018/03/Kuhn_theory_choice.pdf">Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice</a></cite>, and justify why the <cite>Linked Research</cite> design principles describes a paradigm that can be further investigated towards genuine scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

              <hr />

              <p><cite>The Gutenberg Galaxy</cite> and <cite>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite> were coincidently published in 1962. While the accomplishments of McLuhan and Kuhn had differences in methodology and structure, they reveal the overwhelming effects of patterns of change when new technologies and paradigms are adopted by society. These major communication shifts in society as a whole, and specifically in the mode of scientific inquiry, are rare and significant events in history. Content follows form; mediums and paradigms shape the space.</p>

              <p>As the characteristics of the spoken word carried over to writing, and writing to print, print media also influenced electronic media like the Web and hypermedia. Print's typography and knowledge organisation affects the standards, tools, and interfaces that are still used today to exchange knowledge on the Web, as well as certain social expectations or assumptions. For example, authoring tools help us to design and create electronic documents that resemble print representations even if they are not intended to be printed. McLuhan described this phenomenon as though looking at the <q>rear-view mirror</q>; <q>the old medium is always the content of the new medium</q>, <cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/thisismarshallmcluhanthemediumisthemessage">This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, 1967, Marshall McLuhan. While scholarly communication is moving forward by adopting the Web, the content is drawn from the print world.</p>

              <p>We need to examine our assumptions about scholarly communication on the Web in order to understand its social implications.

The focus of the rest of this section is on structural changes in scholarly communication, as opposed to the evolution of technical advancements.</p>

The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to  
make an easy but powerful global information system.

The project started with the philosophy that much academic information should  
be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within  
internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by  
support groups.</pre>

              <p>The World Wide Web is inherently social. In <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164" title="Chapter 10: Web of People, p123">Weaving the Web</a></cite>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> states that he <q cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164">designed it for a social effect – to help people work together – and not as a technical toy</q>. The Web's remarkable growth is fundamentally due to its social characteristics above anything else.</p>
              
              <p>In <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ReadWriteLinkedData">Read-Write Linked Data</a></cite>, Berners-Lee states that the Web <q>was originally developed with the goal to be a collaborative space in which people could collectively design, discuss, share and manage things..a place we we are creative jointly ("intercreative™").</q> The technical challenge was to define the basic common rules of protocol for machines to exchange information in a global system.</p>

Interoperability meant that different systems without prior out-of-band knowledge should be able to communicate if they agree to operate based on open standards.

                      <p>URIs make it possible for real or abstract <em>things</em> to be identified. When HTTP URIs are dereferenced different representations (data formats) are made available from corresponding <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">Uniform Resource Locators</a></cite> (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s). While URIs makes it possible to identify (name) things on the Web, URLs make it possible for humans and machines to locate and to interact further with content.</p>

                      <p>The W3C's <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/">URIs, URLs, and URNs: Clarifications and Recommendations 1.0</a></cite> from 2001 to distinguishes their purpose:</p>

                      <dl id="uri-url-urn">
                        <dt>URI</dt>

                      </dl>

                      <p id="generic-resources">A URI represents a resource as a conceptual entity and can have different electronic representations. The degree of genericity of a resource on the other hand is determined by the authority that allocates the URI. For example, a spectrum of URIs - generic to specific - can be assigned to a resource while conceptually being about the same thing. Time, language, content type, and the target medium are some of the common dimensions of genericity that Web software handles - <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Generic">Generic Resources</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p id="uri-ownership">On the Web, any entity is entitled to associate a URI with a resource in accordance with <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-ownership">URI ownership</a></cite>. The approach for the <span class="highlight-uri-scheme">"<span class="highlight-uri-scheme-http">http</span>" scheme</span> and URI ownership is architecturally decentralised in that the location of a resource can physically exist anywhere in the world. However, architectural decentralisation is ultimately influenced by political or social centralisation at different levels. The <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a></cite> (<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>) is one such hierarchically decentralised structure for naming resources connected to the Internet. It is a kind of a social centralisation in that the <cite><a href="https://www.icann.org/">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a></cite> (<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>) coordinates the management of <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">domain names</a></cite>, where top-level domains for like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc920">countries, categories, multiorganization</a>, are then under the authority of specific organisations. Individuals then typically register fully qualified domain names (and map them to <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses) through accredited registries. Since DNS is a social construct, it can be brought down or controlled by an authority; states or people. As long as we continue to pay the required fees and manage the name server assignment, we can continue to use the URIs under that domain. Let us not forget that <q>you don't buy domain names, you rent them</q> - attributed to Ester Dyson, ICANN chair.</p>

                      <p id="uri-http-context">In this thesis, I focus mostly on URIs with the <span class="highlight-uri-scheme">"<span class="highlight-uri-scheme-http">http</span>" scheme</span>. As specified in <a href="#axiom-2b">Axiom 2b: identity</a>, the owner of the HTTP URI defines the identity relationship which exists between a URI and the resources associated with it. Their reuse and persistence are defined by the information publisher - which may be also be the "owner" of the URI space. We will come back to <cite><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#persistence-and-preservation">Persistence and Preservation</a></cite> later.</p>

                    <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                      <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different Web protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123">Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title="Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support">RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, the focus is on HTTP for data communication, ie. the structured requests and responses exchanged by Web agents. For example, when a Web browser initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></cite>, commonly referred to as <cite>Representational State Transfer</cite> (<abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>): a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems. There are diverse Web agents, eg. browsers, servers, autonomous scripts, with different capabilities, hence as per <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing</a></cite> (<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing">RFC 7230</abbr>), not all agents are expected to make the same interactions that are presented to them.</p>

                      <p id="safe-interactions">There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource's state does not change. When an agent makes a retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending an <code>HTTP POST</code> request with a payload can get a response indicating that a new resource was created, that the resource represented by the URI was deleted by an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> request, or that the agent is unauthorised to either create or delete the resource.</p>

                      <p id="representations">When a client requests a resource, the server may return a <em>particular</em> representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in the HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

                      <p>HTTP request and response functions can be expressed as follows:</p>

                      <figure class="equation" id="http-request-response">

                        <p><em>Method</em> denotes the kind of HTTP request; <em>IRI</em> identifies the target resource for the request; <em>Header</em> provides context about the request and response eg. the <code>Content-Type</code> header indicates the format of the content in <em>Body</em>.</p>

                      <p>The Web architecture has no constraints on the type of data formats that can be exchanged between clients and servers. A resource state may have different representations for the information it encodes. For example, HTML+RDFa, Turtle, JSON-LD, and RDF/XML are some RDF serialization formats - discussed in <a href="#rdf-syntaxes">RDF syntaxes</a> - that can be used to express the same information (semantics) of a resource.</p>

                      <p id="the-rule-of-least-power">On designing computer systems and choosing languages, <cite><a about="" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html" rel="cito:agreesWith">The Rule of Least Power</a></cite> by the W3C Technical Architecture Group recommends that <q cite="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">when publishing on the Web, you should usually choose the least powerful or most easily analyzed language variant that’s suitable for the purpose</q>. Berners-Lee references <a href="#rdf-syntaxes">RDF</a> as a common language for the Web in <cite>Principles of Design, <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles#PLP">Principle of Least Power</a></cite>: <q about="" cite="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles#PLP" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles#PLP">the Semantic Web is an attempt, largely, to map large quantities of existing data onto a common language so that the data can be analyzed in ways never dreamed of by its creators</q>.</p>

                      <p>Berners-Lee states that a declarative language is preferable to a procedural language as declarative stores the data in reusable ways. HTML for example not only turned out to be simple for people to author, its modularity and extensibility paved the way for other standards. In this thesis, we use XHTML and HTML interchangeably (except when explicitly mentioning the lower-level differences in W3C specifications and tooling). Different kinds of <em>language mixing</em> - composition of data formats - emerged, including for example <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">Cascading Style Sheets</a></cite> (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>), <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/">Mathematical Markup Language</a></cite> (<abbr title="Mathematical Markup Language">MathML</abbr>), and <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics</a></cite> (<abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>) in or alongside HTML. The extension mechanisms in HTML and CSS allowed new semantics or features to be declared in the content that can be processed by conforming Web agents. Web agents get to choose whether to ignore unrecognised content or try to understand and treat unrecognised patterns as errors. When a browser encounters a syntactical error in an XHTML document, it can stop processing the document or display an error to the user, also known as draconian error-handling. An HTML document on the other hand has a more forgiving error-handling model. An unrecognised component or non well-formed structure would not prevent processing and no alert needed to be passed to the user interface. To date, HTML acts as a unifying language for human interfaces to information systems.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The Web architecture initially used HTML as the language to represent and connect hypermedia documents with one another. HTML's success is indisputable today, and that's perhaps due to its simplicity to create and reuse; its flexibility, for partial understanding to proceed; and its extensibility to allow language mixing.  While the HTML specification continues to evolve by reflecting on the needs of the Web, by design it is scoped to creating and connecting Web documents and applications.</p>

                  <p>Nevertheless, the potential <em>language</em> <q>to describe the interrelationships between things</q> as originally proposed in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information Management: A Proposal</a></cite> was not fully realised until the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts">Resource Description Framework</a></cite> (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) came along. RDF is a constructed machine-interpretable language to describe and interlink arbitrary things at any level of abstraction on the Web, and reuses the existing architecture of the Web. In <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-12-31T10:46:02Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20181231104602/http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/">Sense and Reference on the Web</a></cite>, Halpin, 2009, states that in the context of RDF (and the <q>Principle of Linking</q>), <q cite="http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/homepage/thesis/#SECTION00622000000000000000">URIs are primarily referential and may not lead to access unlike links in traditional hypertext systems</q>.</p>

                  <p>Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By <em>naming</em> things with URIs, we can construct structured sentences with RDF. By comparison, HTML at its core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge. RDF on the other hand is intended to be a unifying language for machine interfaces to data systems. Later on we will further discuss language mixing with RDF in HTML and XML-family languages.</p>

                  <p id="aaa">By design, the Web works by <q cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot.html#ER">anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title="Anyone can say Anything about Anything">AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that, while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open-world Assumption">OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption">closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Closed-world Assumption">CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of knowledge does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information. Hence, an important distinction: assertions made using the RDF language are claims, as opposed to facts.</p>

                  <p><em>Statements</em> in RDF are expressed in the form of <em>triples</em> - <span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">subject</span>, <span class="highlight-language-predicate">predicate</span>, <span class="highlight-language-object">object</span></span>:</p>

                  <p>The <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987">International Resource Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="International Resource Identifiers">IRI</abbr>) is a generalisation of URI (US-ASCII) in that a wider character set (Unicode/ISO 10646) can be used to identify resources on the Web. A Blank node (anonymous resource) is a local identifier scoped to the context it is used in, eg. file, RDF store, and they are not intended to be persistent or portable. Literals are used for values like strings, numbers, and dates.</p>

                  <p id="rdf-graph-theory">A set of triples in RDF (an <cite>RDF Graph</cite>) can be represented as a directed edge-labelled graph: <math alttext="upper G equals left-parenthesis upper V comma upper L comma upper E right-parenthesis" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where <math alttext="upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math> is the set of <e>vertices</e> (union of subject and object terms), <math alttext="upper L" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></math> is a set of edges labels (predicate terms), and <math alttext="upper E" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> contains triples from <math alttext="upper V vector-or-cross-product upper L vector-or-cross-product upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>. A subject may have several predicates, and predicates can also be mapped to subjects given that they have their own identity.</p>

                  <p>The structure of RDF statements is similar to:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a></cite> sentence structure in <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology">linguistic typology</a></cite> - used by nearly half of human languages</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>We can represent the sentence "<span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">Otlet</span> <span class="highlight-language-predicate">influenced</span> <span class="highlight-language-object">Berners-Lee</span></span>" in one of the RDF syntaxes as follows:</p>

                  <p id="self-describing">As ad-hoc exploration is one of the goals of the Web, the W3C TAG Finding <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/selfDescribingDocuments">The Self-Describing Web</a></cite>, 2009, reports how HTTP and other Web technologies can be used to <q>create, deploy and access <em>self-describing</em> Web resource representations that can be correctly interpreted.</q> It is expressed that the RDF language can be used to integrate with the Semantic Web such that the information encoded in a representation explicitly provides interoperable means to relate Web resources.</p>

                  <p id="follow-your-nose">RDF facilitates a uniform <q>follow your nose</q> type of exploration by following the relations in statements in order to arrive at another unit of <em>self-describing</em> information. The uniformity in graph traversal enables applications to meaningfully interpret and integrate with disparate data without having any out-of-band knowledge, and retrieve more information about the terms as they need to from the source. As the content identified at <code class="highlight-language-subject">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Otlet</code> describes itself, in the same way, the relation <code class="highlight-language-predicate">http://dbpedia.org/ontology/influenced</code> defines itself, and when we inspect a representation of <code class="highlight-language-object">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Berners-Lee</code>, we will find that it describes itself.</p>

                  <p>We can describe <span class="highlight-language-subject">Berners-Lee's IRI</span> (subject) by giving it a human-readable <span class="highlight-language-predicate">name</span> (predicate):</p>

                      <p>While IRIs can be used to identify resources, retrieval mechanisms use URIs because the request URI in HTTP protocol is defined as a URI. Hence, the characters in IRI are first mapped to their URI counterparts before the request process.</p>

                  All of these areas are pertinent to the future of scholarly communication, and Web Science as a field provides a framework for ensuring we consider the various social and technical issues as part of an interconnected ecosystem.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the same vein, furthering the the study of <em>Web Science</em> itself can be done through advancements in how we communicate scholarly findings; through better enabling universal access and connections within knowledge. </p>

                  <p class="todo">Put in Intro: This thesis falls into the domain of Web Science as scholarly communication is inherently social and has broad implications across society. In particular, the thesis examines autonomous and interoperable information systems in context of conducting scholarly communication on the Web. </p>

                  <p id="global-village">The Web not only expedited the flow of human knowledge with a friendly interface, it enabled social interactions to take place which would not have been possible otherwise due to physical or social constraints. The global adoption of the Web brought new forms of human association and social action. In essence, the Web creates one form of a <q>global village</q>, described by McLuhan, whereby there is greater requirement of individuals to participate than with earlier forms of electric media (eg. telegraph, electric light, telephone, radio, television). Nevertheless, the way the society reacts to the medium of the Web is perhaps more important than the content that is on it.</p>

                  <p>The openness of the Web and the ease of involvement for both humans and machines (through common protocols) helped its great expansion without a particular central point of failure or coordination. Scholarly communication could be exemplary of different kinds of agents interacting on the Web, whether they are sentient or something else.</p>

                  <p>Bruce draws attention to the dialectical in that an observer enters into a <q>deep experience</q> of reading, engaging with the text with a critical eye, drawing advanced information and interpretations beyond what is merely presented, and actively seeking to understand the material in addition to political, social, and historical dimensions. Bruce states that under the dialectical view, the Web's multimodal features allows new values and ways of making meaning as an holistic involvement for the consumer.</p>

There are undoubtedly many exciting initiatives and developments that use Internet protocols which can address many of the same challenges (and maybe even better), however it would take more than one thesis to do these justice.

              <p>The publication and dissemination of information - in the most general sense of the words - played a key role in the advancement of societies' knowledge for centuries. The first journal, <cite>Academie des Scavans</cite> published by <cite>The Royal Society</cite> in 1665, evolved out of the exchange of letters among scholars and the transcripts of the meetings in scholarly societies. With this in mind, the most widely accepted purpose of a scholarly article is as a way to communicate research results and other intellectual work with the public; to have an accurate archival record of the research findings; to build on top of earlier knowledge; as well as to have it serve towards crediting authors for their work. Today's scholarly journals, containing quality-controlled research reports, closely resemble the first journal. From early on, due to the growth and demand for copies of the literature from non-members, mostly institutions, the larger journals began to sell subscriptions at relatively higher prices than members pay [<cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/773482913">Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications</a></cite>, Scholarly Journals, Vol. 2, p. 688, 2003].</p>

                  <p>In 1991, recognizing the need for scholars to expedite the exchange of scholarly information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg">Ginsparg</a> created the <abbr title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">LANL</abbr> preprint archive for <q>e-prints</q>. This provided a moderated central repository where scientists can deposit their articles to make them accessible to anyone, which was a cost-effective solution (estimates were less than 5 USD per submission for administration) for scholars to disseminate research results quickly [<cite><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">Creating a global knowledge network</a></cite>]. It initially started out as a central mailbox with an interface; it adopted FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and finally the World Wide Web in 1994. The articles in the repository are not expected to be peer-reviewed, but rather a place where versioned <q>preprints</q> - considered to precede publications that are peer-reviewed - can be accessed for free. In 2001, the LANL preprint archive eventually became what is currently known as <cite><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a></cite>. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/license">arXiv license information</a> permits different rights and licenses to be assigned to the scholarly records, ie. anything from public domain, Creative Commons licenses, or with copyright to the publisher or author, provided that arXiv is given sufficient rights to distribute. The repository accepts submissions in TeX, PDF, PostScript, and HTML. This sort of discipline-centric and institution-run preprint exchange mechanism had the technical ingredients to serve as a substitute for the traditional scholarly journal. From 1991 to 2017, arXiv had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">linear increase in submission rate</a> (passing the 1 million mark in 2015). arXiv's early success lead to the emergence of the <a href="#open-archiving">Open Archives Initiative</a> in 1999, and the <a href="#open-access">Open Access</a> movement in 2002.</p>

                  <p>After some years of prototyping and researcher-centric initiatives, the ideas eventually formulated into the <cite><a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a></cite> (<abbr title="Budapest Open Access Initiative">BOAI</abbr>) in 2002. BOAI is based on the principle that publicly funded research output should be made immediately available, and indefinitely, without access fees and free from most restrictions on copying and reuse, to increase visibility and uptake:</p>

                  <blockquote cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">
                    <p>The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which scholars give to the world without expectation of payment. Primarily, this category encompasses their peer-reviewed journal articles, but it also includes any unreviewed preprints that they might wish to put online for comment or to alert colleagues to important research findings. There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature. By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.</p>

                  <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title="Open Access">OA</abbr>):</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><q id="boai-self-archiving">I. archives-and-repositories</q> (also called <q>green OA</q>)</li>
                    <li><q id="boai-open-access-journals">II. Open-access Journals</q> (also called <q>gold OA</q>).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><cite><a href="http://cogprints.org/1642/1/nature4.htm">The archives-and-repositories initiative</a></cite> is primarily the act of depositing free copies of <q cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">refereed journal articles in open electronic archives</q>. The approach for authors archives-and-repositories was initially implemented through institutional or disciplinary repositories.</p>

                  <p>The term <q>self-archiving</q> in context of OA differs from that of the early practices around preprint services in that there were no constraints set for the status of the scholarly literature, ie. reviewed or not. For OA-centric scientific literature, quality-control and certification are integral, and are paired with registration and archiving functions. With that, self-archiving entails that a copy of the canonical representations of literature - the version of the publication that can be cited by others - is freely accessible and available. OA can be considered to have a coupled model with respect to the <a href="#forces-and-functions">four functions in scholarly communication</a> as defined by Roosendaal and Geurts.</p>

                  <p>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time when the major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature were through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title="Article Processing Charge">APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. The emergence and growing use of APC model provided a stable revenue stream to <em>publishers</em> [<cite><a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/"></a></cite>], while the technical infrastructure remained relatively unchanged, ie. print-centric publication formats still prevail. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees - averaging around 1000 USD per article [<cite><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-124"></a></cite>]).</p>

                  <p>The core approach of this thesis is closer to BOAI-1, in that researchers are actively involved in registering, creating awareness, and archiving their scholarly contributions by available means.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li><q>means/end</q> confusion, where journals continue to mimic or replicate existing mechanisms</li>
                    <li>modifications to the system should still match the needs of the traditional scholarly journal</li>
                    <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. In this process, journals with the refereeing process would link to the articles with full content hosted on the authors' Web sites. To get there, however, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                  <p>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, that is, any material that is outside of the traditional scholarly distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

                  <p id="decoupling-scholarly-journal">In <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-10-02T20:12:12Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20181002201212/https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full">Decoupling the scholarly journal</a></cite>, 2012, Priem et al, present an analysis of the four functions of scholarly communication. The article echoes earlier work in that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the current system, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities - activism or innovation - to improve the publishing models or certification mechanisms. The article diverges from the traditional view of separating registration and archiving functions since the latter <q>necessitates both persistent storage and identification</q>. In other words, if a unit of communication is archived, it has also fulfilled registration. The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While the article does not exclude the possibility of units of information being self-hosted and individually-controlled by the researchers, it is not explored further. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structure and organisation of the units in the system. This is analogous to Roosendaal and Geurts' remark on the creation of new information spaces by an ensemble of units of information [<cite></cite>].</p>

The elements of the principles include:</p>

Hence, GDPR is relevant for experiments and studies that include human subjects, personally identifiable information (<abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>), as well as acquired or inferred personal characteristics. In relation to scholarly communication, ie. research as a basis for data processing, GDPR is permissive and indicates exemptions on the <q>processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject</q>, as well as for scientific research purposes including <q>technological development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research.</q></p>

                  <p>The Web goes beyond the confines of the physical paper since ideas are hyper-orthogonal in nature. The user experiences between the Web and print-centric media differ greatly. This section briefly compares PDF and HTML.</p>

                  <p id="tex"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald E. Knuth</a>, the inventor of <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a></cite>, considers it to be a program written using the literate programming approach. <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a></cite>, which is widely used for scholarly articles, is a collection of TeX macros. In some scientific communities, PDFs are usually generated from LaTeX.</p>

                  <p id="pdf"><cite><a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:32000:-2:ed-1:v1:en">Portable Document Format</a></cite> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>) (ISO 32000-2:2017) is intended for displaying and storing, and generally self-contained. However, it is not intended to be editable as the formatting instructions are no longer available. PDF is inherently layout oriented, and it is an optimal format for printing given its high-precision for typography. Third-party scholarly publishers tend to require a fixed layout with typographical guidelines for research documents, hence submissions are often required to be made as PDFs.</p>

                  <p id="xmp">In order to facilitate metadata interchange, an <cite>Extensible Metadata Platform</cite> (<abbr title="Extensible Metadata Platform">XMP</abbr>) package in the form of XML (most commonly serialized as RDF/XML) may be embedded in PDF as per <cite><a href="https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/XMP%20SDK%20Release%20cc-2016-08/XMPSpecificationPart1.pdf">XMP Specification Part 1: Data Model, Serialization, and Core Properties</a></cite> (ISO 16684-1:2012). Otherwise, semantically useful information is not preserved when PDFs are generated, which makes it difficult to go back to source content format.</p>

                  <p id="html-usage">HTML is both a content format for encoding information, and a document format for storing information. HTML is easy to reuse, exploit, process, and extend. HTML does not have a hard page limit, so it can reflow to fit different displays. HTML has ubiquitous support across devices.</p>

                  <p id="html-css-pdf">If HTML is used as the original format to record the information, a PDF copy can be generated on demand, using the specifications of the user. With an accompanying CSS for the HTML, desired layout guidelines can be achieved. Converting from PDF to HTML+CSS is possible, but the precision rests on rendering the view, as opposed to creating a structurally and semantically meaningful document.</p>

                  <p id="pdf-legacy-format">Formatting research articles as PDF comes at the cost of losing access to granular information. Thus, PDF’s primary focus - the presentation layer - leads to legacy documents that are not reusable in the long run. A great amount of <em>reverse-engineering</em> is required to extract the underlying information (like content, tables, figures). The source format (like TeX, <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#jats">JATS</a>, XML, HTML, or other) are often needed instead for content exchange and modifications.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and have similar affordances to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate, although not necessary optimal, for human consumption and reuse, it is insufficient for machine-assisted analysis or reuse. The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration - which machines excel at - and in turn help with human-led tasks.</p>

                  <p>The most wide use of the term <q>semantic publishing</q> in scientific literature is defined in <cite><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1087/2009202">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a></cite>, Shotton (2009). Here the term <q>semantic publishing</q> is constrained to <q>anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers</q>. The authors of <cite><a href="http://www.tkuhn.org/pub/sempub/sempub.dokieli.html">Genuine Semantic Publishing</a></cite> (2017) argue that with respect to the Semantic Web vision, this definition is <q>too restrictive</q> in a sense that it is concerned mainly about narrated information, and <q>too inclusive</q> in that a shallow semantic publication would still qualify, and defer to the fact that the addition of semantics to published works is an established approach. Kuhn and Dumontier argue that the definition for semantic publishing should be broader in that works without a narrative are accounted for, and narrower in the sense that semantic representations should be incorporated at the time of creating and publishing entities.</p>

                  <p>The <q>genuine semantic publishing</q> concept prescribes the notion of publishing 1) <em>machine interpretable</em> formal representations, 2) having <em>essential coverage</em> of the claims, 3) <em>authenticated</em> by the contributors, 4) be a <em>primary</em> component of the work, and 5) be part of <em>fine-grained</em> and <em>light-weight</em> containers.</p>

                  <p>There is more to simply publishing machine-readable scientific data on the Web. Analogous to the <q>FAIR principles</q>, data needs to "signal" potential opportunities for <em>reuse</em> as per <cite><a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/29982854/POST-PEER-REVIEW-NON-PUBLISHERS.PDF">Why Linked Data is Not Enough for Scientists</a></cite> (<em>Research Objects</em>).</p>

Authors having the means to express the citations as well as their intentions in a structured way can potentially improve the preservation of the connections between research assertions or units of information in general.</p>

                  <p>In <cite><a data-versiondate="2019-01-20T13:05:38Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20190120130538/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06587.pdf" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06587.pdf">Measuring academic influence: Not all citations are equal</a></cite>, Turney et al, 2015, posit the importance of distinguishing the variety of functions that citations perform, in contrast to merely counting the instances of a citation mention to determine the impact or relevance of cited entities. The unique identifiers that are used in research citations commonly refer to scholarly objects at the document level. The intention of the referencing however may range from a particular statement to the whole article. While document level identifiers would be sufficient for general purpose citations about the document, they are not granular or specific enough to connect distinct units of information in research communication. This may be due to a number of reasons, like the unavailability or inability to obtain a precise identifier, or an authoring or referencing environment to create them in the first place. Another consequence of the absence of unique identifiers for the purpose of citations is that, authors' intent for the citation may be preserved only in prose. However, such information in prose is not particularly machine-readable until there is post-processing to extract such information. That is, entity-recognition techniques are typically required to understand the original intentions of citations. This is generally a complicated task and error prone given that an algorithm in essence attempts to reverse-engineer the purpose of the citation. Based on that limitation, <cite><a data-versiondate="2019-01-20T13:18:18Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20190120131818/https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/papers/sigdial06.pdf" href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/papers/sigdial06.pdf">An annotation scheme for citation function</a></cite>, Teufel et al, 2006, proposes a classification system to help mark the relationship information for citations towards improving automatic recognition to build better citation indexers, as well as to have more accurate interpretations of scientific arguments.</p>

              <p>The scholarly ecosystem is inherently social. People collaborate and share.</p>

              <p>There are both grassroots (bottom-up) changes in the publishing practice, as well as top-down, profit-driven and other third-party influences on the ecosystem.</p>

              <p>Communities of practice. Communities within and across institutions.. science is a global undertaking. Techniques for doing for science, the tools that are sued, the way works are assigned value or authority.. different things that are adopted in terms of technologies or methods, for publishing and dissemination of scientific work... Changes of how things are done shift over time in waves.. a slow process.. but sub-communities influence one another.</p>

              <p>We're going to look at 'social' like tools that are somehow affecting or influencing scholarly comms in general (not necessarily decentralised ones). How is massive adoption of social media affecting academia? How are organisations taking advantage (or not) of this?</p>

              <p>(you're going to do a comparison of tools and stuff, like academia.edu, stuff like this would not exist if social media in general had not become popular. This is the answer to the question 'how is social media affecting scholarlycomms?')</p>

              <p>Why are we caring about this? -&gt; We need to understand/reflect/observe/analyse the effects of the tools we use on the ecosystem and on science</p><p>

                  <p id="mastodon"><cite><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></cite> is a decentralised social network based on open Web protocols and <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon">free, open-source software</a>. Mastodon uses the ActivityPub protocol, hence the server is capable of communicating with other servers and clients based on ActivityPub - a federation universe (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse"><abbr title="federation universe">fediverse</abbr></a>). Users of the system can exchange different kinds of social media (text, pictures, video) optionally with content warnings, different ways to organising and moderating content - without being subject to algorithmic content - as well as personal privacy settings. In contrast to centralised social networks, it is intended to shift the focus to individuals and different communities communicating under their own autonomy. In addition to individuals capable of running their own instances, there are search interfaces to help individuals find existing servers with a particular topic of interest or language, that are operated by independent organisations with different moderation policies. Besides its UI being available in the Web browser, there are plethora of native mobile and desktop client applications, other tooling to communicate with instances, as well as bridges from/to other non-AP based platforms.</p>

                  <p id="scholar-social"><cite><a href="https://scholar.social/">Scholar Social</a></cite> is a Mastodon instance geared towards scientists, academics, librarians, and scholars with topical focus on scholarly communication. The site has a feature for a monthly journal club, in which its members can suggest a scholarly article of interest, read, and comment collectively. It also has an explicit code of conduct encouraging inclusivity and exercising academic freedom. While Scholar Social is just one particular community, it marks a milestone for academics discovering others in a multi-disciplinary field, as well as academic content in a social setting. At minimum, both fulfil the awareness function in scholarly communication. Hence, ActivityPub can be used by individuals as a single-user of a platform, as well as by communities - institution run or otherwise - which serve their own needs, while optionally being able to communicate with the rest of the federation.</p>

                  <p>Identifying units on the (scholarly) Web can be done with different kinds of social agreements and expectations. Here we discuss a few that pertain to registration of identifiers:</p>

                  <p id="purl"><cite><a href="https://purl.org/">Persistent Uniform Resource Locator</a></cite> (<abbr title="Persistent Uniform Resource locator">PURL</abbr>) is a way to provide an HTTP URL a permanent redirect to another HTTP URL. PURLs can be registered and managed by anyone. The PURL service is currently administered by the <cite><a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a></cite>.</p>

There are shared second-level paths eg. for people, that can be registered the same way. The service is flexible in that different server rules for redirections can be set. In the event that </p>

                  <p id="doi"><cite><a href="https://doi.org/">Digital Object Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr>) is an international standard for document identification, and the services that are offered through doi.org is managed by the International DOI Foundation (at the time of this writing). The foundation permits <a href="http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html">registration agencies</a> to manage DOI records. In order to have a resource assigned with a DOI, it has to be done through one of the DOI registration agencies. Given the statement in AWWW, <q><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence">URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of scientific artefacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself; the latter happens to be a common practice in the scholarly information space. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system's <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI's lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

                  <p id="orcid"><cite><a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor ID">ORCID</abbr>) is a community-governed persistent identifier system for researchers and organisations. An ORCID identifier is specified as a URI. While anyone can create and update their ORCID profile, the identifier is ultimately owned and managed by the ORCID organisation and made available through <code>orcid.org</code>. Profiles are constrained to express to the UI's template and the kind of information ORCID is willing to store. For most intents and purpose, the free service offered by ORCID is sufficient for researchers, and provides a mechanism where researchers can aggregate information about their education, employment, funding, and works like academic publications and data. It also allows researchers to extend their profile descriptions, as well as linking to their alternative online profiles.</p>

The <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a></cite> is a service that allows users to search and access archived Web documents in particular. The Wayback Machine can be used to navigate through different versions of URLs based on the date-time in which they were accessed and stored. For example, all of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://csarven.ca/">captures of csarven.ca</a> as well as the other articles of the site are available, along with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/details/http://csarven.ca/">summary</a>.

PURL, w3id, ORCID, and DOI as described above are PIDs. PIDs are intended to be used as a long-lasting reference to a unit of information. For example, a DOI-based PID can be <samp>10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp>, and the organisation - in this case the International DOI Foundation - would be responsible to unambiguously map it to an accessible resource. Typically the process starts from a DOI URI <samp>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.320</samp> which (currently) resolves to <samp>http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/9.1.331</samp>.

However, for some research, reproduction is not always possible, for example when data is sensitive, or influenced by time or space. In this case, replication can be carried out to answer the same research questions using similar or equivalent approaches. The reproduction of the original work can be either confirmatory, ie. able to reproduce, or; contradictory, unable to reproduce or inconclusive. Thus, in order to reconstruct how the data was generated and to make sense of it, data needs to be accompanied by enough detail about its provisional interpretations.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The scientific communication 'market' is an interplay between actors with an objective to exchange units of information along the lines of: academic literature, analysis, annotations (eg. assessments, bookmarks, comments), datasets, evidence, interactive representations, software, observations, provenance, and workflows. Further, researchers commonly want to expose their work beyond the scientific community to the wider world, seeking adoption or contradiction of new ideas and findings.</p>

              <p>In <cite><a href="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/conferences/crisp97/roosendaal.html">Forces and functions in scientific communication</a></cite> (1997) Roosendaal and Geurts provide a framework which has had historical influence on research and development pertaining to technical challenges on interoperability, workflows, service sharing, and information modeling in scholarly communication. Through this thesis, I will refer back to these concepts as a means to describe and compare various technologies and approaches to scientific publishing.</p>

              <p>Roosendaal and Geurts disassemble the scientific communication market as an interplay between four forces and functions. The dynamics between the forces and functions is described as a tetrad:</p>

              <h3>Forces</h3>

              <p>The scientific communication market consists of four forces with each having complementary parts: <em>actors</em>, <em>accessibility</em>, <em>content</em>, and <em>applicability</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Actor</dt>
                <dd>Any kind of interactive agent that creates or uses information, eg authors, readers, tool implementers, policy makers, application programs.</dd>

              <h3>Functions</h3>

              <p>Scientific communication consists of four functions: <em>registration</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>certification</em>, and <em>archiving</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Registration</dt>
                <dd>Allows claims of precedence for a scientific activity</dd>
                <dt>Awareness</dt>
                <dd>Remaining informed of the observations</dd>
                <dt>Certification</dt>
                <dd>Establishes the validity of registered claims</dd>
                <dt>Archiving</dt>
                <dd>Preservation of scholarly records over time</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the scholarly market, and are considered to be indispensable in that there would not be a scientific communication market if there are no researchers and the artefacts they exchange. The accessibility and applicability forces on the other hand are external forces because they shape, give purpose to, or influence the activities and content.</p>

              <p>The registration and archiving are objective functions in that they are external to the research process. Information exchange cannot take place if there are no usable identifiers for the units of communication or if no knowledge preservation measures are put in place. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions - internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of making information findable, or <em>scientific observations</em>. Certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. they act as filtering mechanisms in the information space.</p>

              <p>With respect to the four forces and functions, The FAIR principles describe a particular class of technical characteristics.</p>

              <p>In today's scholarly publishing, the journal article is considered to have four chief functions:</p>

              <p id="rethinking-scholarly-communication">In <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> (2004), Van de Sompel et al. propose to revise the notion of a unit of scholarly communication in two ways. In a technological sense, it suggests to recognise the compound and dynamic nature of units that work on the Web. Content can be the result of a combination of other registered items; data may be available through interactions, or depend on acquiring externally registered items. Van de Sompel et al. state that in order to empower scholarly communities from a systems perspective, there should be more flexibility in what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow registration, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered. Van de Sompel et al. also acknowledge the presence of an additional function in the market which reflects the academic credit and policy in the current system. A derived function, <q>rewarding</q> of actors <q>for their performance in the communication system based on metrics derived from that system</q>. For rewarding to take place, the information space needs to provide the ability to extract meaningful metrics.</p>

              <p>Given that the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem, as well as the research process becoming more visible on the Web (per the <q>Open Science</q> movement), Van de Sompel et al. also posit that the aforementioned indicators impact the functions in scientific communication, and in particular have a significant impact on the future of archiving. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. They describe the effect of Web-based archiving with respect to the four functions:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>registration: a wide variety and versions of objects that are compound, dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent are available from different Web platforms;</li>
                <li>certification: a variety of mechanisms that are decoupled from registration;</li>
                <li>awareness: a variety of objects being communicated in real-time and social;</li>
                <li>archiving: <q>no constraints on the number or kinds of parties that can hold archived copies</q>, the need for <q>appropriate levels of cross-archive interoperability in order to support seamless, uniform access to archived objects</q>, that are temporally appropriate while context being preserved</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Van de Sompel et al. conclude that in order to address the needs of a distributed archival approach for scholarly Web objects, using standards towards interoperability will play a central role.</p>

              <p>Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration, stepping through the four functions in order (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), turns out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> that the essential functions need to be <q cite="https://hvdsomp.info/papers/Papers/2014/iPres2014_Sompel_Treloar.pdf">fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfil these functions</q>. The act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The authors distinguish recording and archiving in that the former is short-term, no guarantees provided, used for many read-write operations, and part of a scholarly process. Archiving serves a different function, in that it is intended for the long-term, and there is an attempt of a guarantee (or promise) and the archived artefact becomes part of the scholarly record.</p> 

              <p>The authors call for another archival paradigm that is based off the characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document on the Web may refer to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, and changing or ephemeral objects. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material - physical paper - can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree to which it can be archived. The complexity and care that is required for the proper preservation of digital objects is further described in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html">Requirements for Digital Preservation Systems</a></cite> (2005), where Rosenthal et al. provide a taxonomy of threat models: software, communication, network, economic, organisational, to name a few, which pose a particular risk to permanent information loss. Thus, it is important to bare these potential issues in mind when considering what scholarly units of information will contain and how they will be made available.</p>

              <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations, instantaneously as the events occur, or after the fact around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholarly activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

              <p>In order to help us understand the effects of the Web on scholarly communication, we can use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/Marshall_McLuhan" rel="cito:credits">McLuhan</a>'s tetrad of media effects as a heuristic device; a set of four questions:</p>

              <blockquote cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom">
                <ul>
                  <li>What does it enhance or intensify?</li>
                  <li>What does it render obsolete or displace?</li>
                  <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolesced?</li>
                  <li>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme?</li>
                </ul>
                <footer><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">Laws of Media</a></cite>, p. 7</footer>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The questions are intended to be complimentary and studied simultaneously. They correspond to four effects: <q>enhances</q>, <q>obsolesces</q>, <q>retrieves</q>, and <q>reverses into</q>. I use this tetrad to situate the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication on the Web in relation to adjacent mediums, in particular, to print media:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Enhances</dt>
                <dd>access to information, autonomy, social connections, decentralisation, distribution, immediacy, multi-modality</dd>
                <dt>Obsolesces</dt>
                <dd>centralisation, isolation, distance, memorisation, privacy, tactility, travel, linearity, typographical conventions</dd>
                <dt>Retrieves</dt>
                <dd>community, correspondence, direct representation, free expression, dialogue, involvement, public space, self-control</dd>
                <dt>Reverses into</dt>
                <dd>collectivism, degraded information quality, group-think, information overload, fabrication, lack of accountability, information, noise, third-party control</dd>
              </dl>

              <p id="inspecting-effects-and-artefacts">The tetrad serves as a conceptual categorisation of impacts of a medium. It allows us to outline and analyse what the medium enables or has implications for based on observations in "the real world", or in day-to-day academic practice. In particular, we can examine the Web's effects and artefacts with regards to composition of scholarly information, individual autonomy to create and consume knowledge, and sociality of scholarly communication.</p>

              <p>By examining these effects, we can hone in on understanding what the underlying <em>form</em> does to us, society at large, and scientific communication itself. It provides us with a foundation to go further in uncovering the nature of scholarly communication's interplay with the Web. What has it shaped? What are the current challenges? How do we envision the communication to be? How can we use the medium better whether through its original intentions or new?</p>

              <p>The technicalities of these inquiries can have various manifestations, hence this thesis is only intended to reveal a particular configuration which situates itself around <em>contributor-centric scholarly communication on the Web</em>.</p>

              <p>How is scientific communication changed by the mediums employed?</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In the 1967 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="schema:url">The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote: <q about="" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653">at the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevant or effective</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]. While McLuhan’s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class="cool-media">World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class="hot-media">print</em>, considered to be a <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the full attention of our vision. As the printed word’s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class="typographic-sine-wave"><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt’s laws of grouping</a>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>

              <p>The interaction of media with our senses is an inherent property of media. The media's built-in sensory bias affects and transforms human society and psyche. Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to connect and exchange ideas, behaviour, or style with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">mechanical movable type printing press</a> (circa 1450), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a “publication”? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

              <p>Today, it is evident that the typical publishing scenario for scholarly knowledge predominantly requires strict adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class="unicode-document">page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data for any given research and development, ie. noteworthy items which the researcher knows, wants to communicate and demonstrate, must be channeled through the characteristics of the print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the qualities of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats are primarily designed and destined for printing and physical distribution - circulate in scientific circles and on the Web, we can make one observation: such formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying to exist and remain relevant inside a cool medium. We can observe this even in the case of electronic formats and presentations that mimic the old medium; the physical paper.</p>

              <p>Today's scholarly communication includes some of the effects of the Web, however, it still draws its sociotechnical organisation from the print age and the refereed journal system. It operates as a visual medium. The intention is not to undermine the values of the print-centric approach, but to explore and apply native features of the Web to scholarly communication; autonomous involvement, mass access to create, read, and experience knowledge, and perhaps most importantly, social engagement.</p>

              <p>Our aim is to first acknowledge initiatives and developments that went into scholarly communication in the age of information and Web. If at all, how did the scientific and scholarly community change by the instruments they have employed? Following this analysis, we will move on to devising a scholarly space that is more fitting to the Web - medium.</p>
