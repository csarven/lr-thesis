            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The term <q>information society</q> is used to loosely denote increasingly central role of information and communication technologies in social and economic activity. With the advent of the Internet and the Web, the production, distribution, and consumption of instantaneously accessible networked knowledge has further shaped social policies and practices around the world.</p>

              <p>As discussed earlier, throughout history, the complex connections between communication technologies and society transformed control structures of civilisations. Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan argued that electronic media, unlike any other, compressed time and space - creating a <q>global village</q> - as well as facilitating the influence and potential of centralised control. While the Internet reinforces democratic (re)distribution of communicative power, and that the Web is inherently decentralised - with the exception of centralised notion of DNS tied to social agreements - today, centralisation of all forms of information exchange and various forms of (algorithmic) censorship - state or self-imposed - is commonplace; from governments, social media services, to increasingly various and variety of large-scale systems that collect, adopt, organise, and share data in diverse sectors. For instance, major information organisations like Google, Facebook, Elsevier, to a long tail of (social) media services, exert a great influence on how and what information can be accessible, expressible, reusable, with respect to the cost of human capital, as well as impact on society by creating information and <q>filter bubbles</q>. In essence knowledge elitism takes different shapes and forms on society. Information control tends to happen through system designs that are inherently centralised.</p>

              <p>The information needs of an individual, community, and society vary from personal, local, to global. For instance, an individual can expect to participate in exchanging knowledge and goods autonomously. Given access to the Internet and the Web, researchers can register and control their URI space; personal data storage and applications; as well as social scholarly activity without intermediaries. Scientific communities can make their discoveries available in the global commons; take part in reproducing and replicating others' findings; be involved in quality-control and certification processes, and interact with participants and information. Given these activities, the output for the society is a democratic knowledge exchange at the global level.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p about="" id="problem-statement" rel="schema:hasPart"><span about="#problem-statement" property="schema:description" typeof="deo:ProblemStatement">While the Web was originally conceived as a decentralised <em>application</em> running on the Internet, where every organisation and individual can participate, it became increasingly centralised with <a class="todo" href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of the servers serving more than 99% of the content</a>. The domination of centralisation is essentially due to economic and state incentives, and it has shaped the technical infrastructure: it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish, and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralised platform. Blogger, YouTube and Facebook, for example, are centralised authoring, publishing, and search platforms for blog posts, videos or social network content respectively.</span></p>

              <p>However, independence of centralised platforms is a necessity for ownership of published ideas, and to establish a relation of trust. For example, Facebook has been accused of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html">bias</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth">false information</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html">censorship</a>—but rather than blaming this on any particular platform, we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation. After all, there is a continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand, and a guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other. In a fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless and responsible for its own quality and reputation, while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources using any mechanism they desire.</p>

              <p>Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation furthermore have the potential to impact areas in which centralisation currently determines the pace of evolution. Scientific publishing, for instance, is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes. Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realised with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts, which has the potential to engage more people sooner. Trust then no longer stems from a finite process with limited transparency, but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation. Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.</p>

              <p>If we want to strengthen the decentralised nature of the Web again, we need to develop technologies to simplify the decentralised authoring, management, exploration, and search of Web content.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Given our half a millennia of experience on mass print publishing, and a half century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. For instance, the Web - a <em>read-write</em> space - inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher" while each researcher can exercise their full creativity without being subject to arbitrary constraints. Any third-party involvement is fundamentally subject to conflict with that notion. Yet, third-party involvement, typically through for-profit service providers injunction with academic institutions and libraries, influence the quality and availability of publicly-funded research output and exchange. The social and professional incentives for academics can be traced to the workflows exerted by external forces.</p>

              <p>If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach to integrate scholarly affairs with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by examining history: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation, with different modes of communication. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community essentially needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing (r)evolution is vital for the advancement of scholarly communication; unchaining itself from antiquated and inadequate practices, towards actual and complete Web-centric information flows and participations, in order to better aid societal advancement.</p>

              <p>The notion of <q>control yourself</q> can postulate that the knowledge creators and participants can objectively demonstrate that self-publishing of different units of communication can be socially, technically, and financially preferable to a third-party's handling of the same information and interactions, as well as their reuse. It opens up the possibility for autonomous (decentralised) participation, enabling universally accessible units that are human and machine-readable, as well as socially aware interactions.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Let us now turn our attention to the technicalities of this matter given the possibilities in the environment that the Web offers, and the feasibility of using certain Web standards and technologies to address certain kinds of challenges in scholarly communication. Due to the nature of current Web applications and services, users (including researchers) do not particularly have free choice or ability to store their documents at locations of their choosing without compromising ownership and access control, and as an effect their privacy and security. This is at the root of <em>information silos</em> that are ultimately controlled by third-party which results in systems designs that are either incapable of or have friction with importing or exporting data, as well as interactions based on interoperable open Web standards and practices. We focus on two areas of centralisation that are at the forefront of the way scholarly communication is conducted on the Web and its ramifications on the rest of the sociotechnical system:</p>

              <ul type="lower-roman">
                <li>data</li>
                <li>application</li>
              </ul>

              <p>While centralisation of data and application are two distinct areas of concern, some of the challenges we face in scholarly communication make them appear as one. They are typically lumped into one pre-packaged process. For instance, when we discuss challenges and issues in access to knowledge, it is not strictly about where data is available from, whether we can or how to obtain the data, or what is its quality (like formats and their affordances) and so forth, but equally about which applications (including communication standards and services) that <em>both</em> humans and machines are required to use or conform to in order to obtain data. Similarly, being required to use a particular set of applications (tools to format articles, services to create an account at, and the terms to agree with) in order to share research artefacts with, equally impose a certain set of characteristics that some data can have, and what happens to the data once we share it with other entities.</p>

              <p>Data and application appear to be intertwined because the workflows that the researchers are required to use tend to be unique and propriety designs are predominantly enforced by third-parties. While some of the differences in designs may be due to historical reasons or technical debt - as a by-product - they also ensure various forms of vendor lock-in on the data and the applications to obtain, create, share or reuse them. The use of non-interoperable (or even post-facto) methods to create and exchange data on the Web leads to the fragmentation of data through silo-services, and along with it the dependency on applications having their interaction mechanisms established via out-of-band knowledge; requiring humans part of the equation at each step. For example, if we strictly focus on the quality of machine-interpretability of scholarly information on the Web, the technical obstacles are evident and ample. The applications for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Latin phrase meaning the existing state of affairs">status quo</span> need to be continuously hard-wired to know what to look for; what to do with or how to handle once something of interest is found; or where to go next in the discovery phase. Similarly, automating discovery; searching and finding, of fine-grained information without human interference is still central to the limitations. Regardless of the technical imperfections, these designs are gains for businesses as they can impose their own set of requirements on their users, and control over data.</p>

              <p>We turn our attention to resolving data and application-based centralisation that are predominantly adopted by third-party (for-profit) companies - often monopolies - for certain Web services, by adopting Web-centric worfklows that are inherently interoperable by design, eg. decentralised and social on the Web, but most importantly enabling the creators and the users of data and applications to be truly autonomous entities. Hence, we strive towards neutrality and democratisation of scholarly knowledge on all levels of access for humans and machines; and decentralisation and decoupling of data and applications while addressing some of the infrastructure limitations and needs in order to conduct genuine scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

              <p>Given that the research processing becoming more visible on the Web (eg. as per the <q>Open Science</q> movement), as well as the nature of objects transitioning to being more content-driven, Van de Sompel posits that the aforementioned indicators impact the functions in scientific communication, and in particular have a significant impact on the future of archiving:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>registration: a wide variety and versions of objects that are compound, dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent are available from different Web platforms;</li>
                <li>certification: a variety of mechanisms that are decoupled from registration;</li>
                <li>awareness: a variety of objects being communicated in real-time and social;</li>
                <li>archiving: <q>no constraints on the number or kinds of parties that can hold archived copies</q>, the need for <q>appropriate levels of cross-archive interoperability in order to support seamless, uniform access to archived objects</q>, that are temporally appropriate while context being preserved</li>

              <p id="distributed-semantic-social-networks">In <cite><a href="http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2011/SWJ_DSSN/public.pdf">An Architecture of a Distributed Semantic Social Network</a></cite>, 2012, and <cite><a href="http://ul.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A12983/attachment/ATT-0/">Distributed Semantic Social Networks: Architecture, Protocols and Applications</a></cite>, 2014, Sebastian Tramp posits that the landscape of Social Web is increasingly losing its distributed nature. Tramp highlights that there is an increased use of centralised social platforms, where users are locked in to their respective platforms with not much opportunity to communicate easily with users on other platforms, as well as difficulty to relocate their social graphs and personal data. Interoperability between platforms being largely limited to proprietary APIs, and changes being at the discretion of the service provider. Users of the online services are being required to keep their - often overlapping - data individually at each platform up to date in order to minimise divergent information. Tramp argues that technical solutions should empower users to regain control and ownership over their data and its use, ensure privacy policies and rules that's user-centric (as opposed to driven by commercial interest), increased data security, information extensibility based on user's needs, reliability through distribution, and freedom of communication without centralised control. The output of Tramp's research is that Semantic Web technologies can be deployed to some extant to support the structure, maintenance, and usage of federated and distributed social networking on the Web. The evaluation is based on integration use case tests, eg. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0">SWAT0</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT1_use_cases">SWAT1</a></cite>, formulated by the W3C <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/">Federated Social Web Incubator Group</a></cite>.</p>

              <p id="data-ownership-and-interoperability-for-a-decentralized-social-semantic-web">In <cite><a href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00917965/document">Data ownership and interoperability for a decentralized social semantic web</a></cite>, 2013, Andrei Vlad Sambra acknowledges the same core challenges of the modern Web as Tramp, and sets out to identify key components that would help achieve true data ownership and interoperability. Sambra demonstrates how a stack of interoperable Web technologies around WebID and Linked Data can be used to build certain class of social Web applications, where users without centralised intermediaries can authenticate themselves, and participate in creating and exchanging data with servers that are equipped with social access controls.</p>

              <p>Both Tramp and Sambra emphasise on using and extending the Web architecture and applying its principles towards a more decentralised notion of information reuse and user interaction. The core approaches use the Linked Data technology stack for publishing, retrieval, and integration; decoupling services and applications from the users data so that content creators are owners and have desired rights on their data and its use; and fostering data extensibility and distribution, as well as privacy.</p>

              <p>While there are plethora of <cite>architecturally significant requirements</cite> that would be necessary to design a system that is sociotechnical in nature, meanwhile encouraging autonomous and interoperable participation on the open Web, we focus on non-functional and functional requirements in this thesis.</p>

              <p><strong>Non-Functional Requirements</strong>: given above initiatives and developments, we derive non-functional requirements for systems to aim at addressing the forces and functions in scientific communication through the following:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><em>Interoperability</em> to improve discovery, accessibility, integrability, and reusability</li>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p id="internet-web-protocols">The foundational communication and transfer protocols of the Internet and the Web (eg. <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>/<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>, <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>) are designed to operate in a decentralised and distributed manner. In terms of global functionality, removing a single node from the network - a machine with an IP address - does not halt the whole network. Similarly, when an HTTP URL is no longer available (eg. typical "404 Not Found", "410 Gone" status messages), the other URLs are not affected. This particular behaviour, where the Web being functional without requiring bi-directional hyperlinks is considered to be a "feature" (rather than a "bug") of the overall system. However, Ted Nelson disputes this design choice with respect to the original Hypertext design.</p>

              <p id="read-write-web">As discussed previously the <abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr> enables the identification, discovery and description of information for the notion of a <q>Read-Write Web</q> where servers and clients interact using Web standards. Generally speaking <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">create, read, update and delete</a></cite> (<abbr title="Create, Read, Update and Delete">CRUD</abbr>) are the basic functions of persistent storage as well as conventions for user-interfaces to view and change information. Each CRUD operation can be mapped to an interaction method of the Web architecture. For example, the request function for HTTP would be: <math alttext="upper R e q u e s t equals upper M e t h o d vector-or-cross-product upper I upper R upper I vector-or-cross-product upper M e d i a upper T y p e vector-or-cross-product upper B o d y" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>Request</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Method</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>IRI</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>MediaType</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>Body</mi></mrow></math>, where <em>IRI</em> being the identifier of a resource, and <em>MediaType</em> indicating the format of the content in <em>Body</em>, the mapping to some HTTP method(s) <em>typically</em> used as follows (implementations may differ in some areas):</p>

              <ul>
                <li><em>create</em>: <code>PATCH</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>;</li>

This is all meanwhile technically and legally enabling participants to retain their autonomy; identity and storage, access and rights over their contributions. In order to achieve this, one of the goals is to make and stimulate an infrastructure where data and applications interacting with such data are decoupled by design. That is, our ability to work with linked data without any constraints on which applications that can be used provided that they follow consensus based open protocols and data models. At the core of this initiative is where users, groups, and applications use global identifiers (URIs), and the capabilities of the storage are access controlled using policies assigned to those identifiers - "socially-aware" - as well appropriate use of the data based on their rights and responsibilities. This also leads to the commodification of read-write data storage - whereby their location on the Web can be decided by its owners and contributors - and the independence of applications interacting with it.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-platform"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr>) specifies a RESTful read-write protocol and vocabulary for Web resources. LDP has distinct notions for <q>resource</q> and <q>container</q>; where the container construct can group and manage resources. LDP uses the RDF data model to describe the state of RDF and non-RDF resources. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/">Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements</a></cite> outlines a wide-range of user stories, use cases, scenarios, and requirements which was used as the bases for the LDP specification. LDP can be used to mimic a file system abstraction interacting with Web resources over HTTP. The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-paging/">LDP Paging</a></cite> mechanism can be used by clients and servers to efficiently request and serve a resource description, eg. resources in a container, in multiple parts. All LDP servers and clients can interact with each other using the same HTTP interface in context of Linked Data to perform CRUD operations.</p>

              <p id="hydra-core-vocabulary"><cite><a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/">Hydra</a></cite> is a vocabulary to enable the creation of hypermedia-driven Web APIs by enabling a server to advertise affordances of its resources - machine-readable valid state transitions - to a client. A client uses this information to construct HTTP requests in order to perform possible read-write operations. Hydra enables generic client applications to be built without hardcoding knowledge about the available operations against Web APIs.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-fragments"><cite><a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">Linked Data Fragments</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Fragments">LDF</abbr>) is the concept of having a uniform view on Linked Data interfaces that can be used towards reliable Web querying. To that end, a client asks a server about the kinds of Linked Data fragments that are available and then dynamically adapts its query plan for the server to execute. A Linked Data fragment is defined by three characteristics: data (what triples does it contain?), metadata (what do we know abut it?), controls (how to access more data?).</p>

              <p id="triple-pattern-fragments"><cite><a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/triple-pattern-fragments/">Triple Pattern Fragments</a></cite> (<abbr title="Triple Pattern Fragments">TPF</abbr>) is one possible way for a server to define a Linked Data fragment that enable live querying over the dataset on the client-side. TPF's hypermedia controls are expressed using the Hydra vocabulary.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-templates"><cite><a href="https://atomgraph.github.io/Linked-Data-Templates/">Linked Data Templates</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Templates">LDT</abbr>) provides the means to define read-write Linked Data APIs declaratively using SPARQL and specify a uniform interaction protocol for them. An LDT based server applies re-usable RDF ontologies to define application structure declaratively as a set of instructions for resource representation processing. To this end, "templating" is where an HTTP operation is mapped to a certain URI pattern that a server executes a SPARQL command in order to drive RDF CRUD processing. When a client triggers a particular request pattern, the server gives a suitable response based on available templates that are identified with URIs.</p>

              <p id="rdf-post"><cite><a href="http://www.lsrn.org/semweb/rdfpost.html">RDF/POST Encoding for RDF</a></cite> uses the W3C HTML 4.01 Recommendation to specify read-write operations of RDF data through form-encoded RDF serialisation. Read operations are done by having an RDF/POST document encoded in HTTP GET URL, and write operations are sent via HTTP POST with form-urlencoded media type.</p>

              <p id="fedora-api"><cite><a href="https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/">Fedora API Specification</a></cite> refines the semantics and interaction patterns of the LDP specification in order to address the needs of repositories for durable access to digital data. Its goal is to facilitate interoperability with client applications. While the interactions patterns provides a mechanism for different client applications to communicate with servers, servers can be expected to vary in the kinds of services and affordances they offer for their resources. Fedora uses LDP as a foundation and defines the version identification and navigation scheme with respect to the Memento specification, integrates resource authorization and Web Access Control rules, provides a design for the publication of event notifications, and interaction patterns to support binary resource fixity verification.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>The design pattern for these Linked Data centric read-write architectures can be categorised as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>the ability to perform CRUD interactions against Web resources</li>
                <li>decoupling software from domain or application-specific operations and data</li>
                <li>declarative and machine-readable affordances for valid read-write operations</li>
              </ul>

              <p id="memento"><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089">HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to Resource States -- Memento</a></cite> (<abbr title="HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to Resource States -- Memento">Memento</abbr>): introduces a uniform, datetime-based, version access capability that integrates present and past Web resources. As representations of resources change over time, there is a need to preserve (archive and version) earlier representations. One common resource versioning pattern on the Web consists of generic URIs referring to the latest version of an accessible resource, as well as having a dedicated version URI for each resource. The Memento framework facilitates the discovery and retrieval of distributed versioned resources with datetime negotiation, a variant of content-negotiation; and TimeMaps an index of URIs referring to the prior states of a resource. The framework also helps to recognise frozen states of resources - a promise that the resource state has not and will not change.</p>

The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/">Activity Vocabulary</a></cite> provides a foundational vocabulary to describe past, present, and future activities eg. announcing, creating, following, offering, and about objects eg. actors, media.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-notifications"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>) is a resource-centric communication protocol for applications to generate notifications about activities, interactions, and new information, which may be presented to the user or processed further. It allows any resource (target) to advertise a receiving endpoint (inbox) for the messages anywhere on the Web. The server (receiver) hosting the inbox can have messages pushed to them by applications (sender), as well as how other applications (consumer) may retrieve those messages. Each notification in an inbox is an identifiable and reusable unit (URI), and can contain any data using any vocabulary.</p>

              <p id="activitypub"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a></cite> (<abbr title="ActivityPub">AP</abbr>) is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the Activity Streams 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for CRUD operations, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and content. User accounts on servers have an inbox (to receive messages from the world), and an outbox (to send messages to others). AP's inbox property is the same as LDN's, and the targeting and delivery mechanism can be interoperably combined.</p>

Hence, users of such systems often cannot easily switch personal data storage services, or reuse their data with similar applications. Authors demonstrate the <cite>Solid platform</cite> to address the challenges in decentralised authentication, data management, as well as the development of interoperable and portable Social Web applications that interact with the platform. A number of servers and client applications are implemented where it is possible to store RDF and non-RDF resources, as well as permitting operations via SPARQL queries for complex data retrieval and link-following. The client-side applications cover common "day-to-day" tasks eg. contacts management, event organisation, collaborative authoring, annotating, and social notifications, all meanwhile users are able to use their WebIDs and switch between applications with similar functions.</p>

              <p id="future-of-social-networking">The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/09/msnws/report.html">W3C Workshop on the Future of Social Networking Report</a></cite>, 2009, concluded that distributed social networking is a possibility on the Web, given available data interoperability technologies, as well as further support of open source implementation of decentralised architectures. At the crux of the initiatives was to: foster preservation of privacy best practices for users; and their ability to trust claims; deepening user contexts and roles in social networking; enabling protocols for exchanging goods and services within communities, and; creating adapted user experienced with improved accessibility and mobility by closing the gap between implementations of social networks and device capabilities.</p>

              <p id="foaf+ssl">One of the consensus of the workshop was that many of the existing technologies needed to create decentralized social networks already existed, eg. FOAF, OpenID, XMPP. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/09/msnws/papers/foaf+ssl.html" title="FOAF &amp; SSL: creating a global decentralised authentication protocol">One of contributions to the workshop</a> was presented by Henry Story et al based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080426014047/http://blogs.sun.com:80/bblfish/entry/foaf_ssl_creating_a_global is">original proposal</a> (combining <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080426142811/http://blogs.sun.com:80/bblfish/entry/rdfauth_sketch_of_a_buzzword">RDFAuth</a></cite> by Henry Story and <cite><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2008Mar/0207.html">sketch of a simple authentication protocol</a></cite> by Toby Inkster in 2008) for the notion of using Semantic Web vocabularies such as <abbr title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</abbr> with SSL certificate exchange mechanism permits distributed and interlinked social networks to exist. The protocol was later posited in <cite><a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2009/Papers/SPOT/foaf-ssl-spot2009.pdf">FOAF+SSL: RESTful Authentication for the Social Web</a></cite>. Its goal was set to protecting and controlling access to personal information distributed on the Web where identification and privacy is at its centre.

              <p id="webid-specs">In order to enable people, group and software to act as autonomous agents that can cooperate on the Web, we need methods for distributed and decentralised identity, secure authentication, and access control. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/">WebID</a></cite> is a group of specifications that outlines approaches meet those needs.</p>

A WebID is an HTTP URI denoting an agent, for example a person, organisation, or software. It can be used towards the declaration of an agent's existence; discovery, describing or reference; authentication; and authorisation. WebID is distributed and decentralised in that any agent can be <em>named</em> anywhere on the Web, and the server hosting the URI space controls the identity. It is extensible in that it can be used injunction with secure authentication and access control mechanism, as well as having dereferenceable machine-readable descriptions which are themselves extensible. WebID can improve privacy, security, and control be in the hands of users.</p>

              <p>While my personal WebID - under my control - is at <a href="http://csarven.ca/#i">http://csarven.ca/#i</a>, I have an ORCID identifier - controlled by the community - that also serves as a WebID: <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-9125">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-9125</a>, which also has an RDF representation. As ORCID's user interface allows people to extend their descriptions with certain fields, it is possible to add <em>same as</em> or <em>preferred URI</em> relations:</p>

              <p>The <code>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>contact:preferredURI</code> information provides an opportunity for applications consuming the ORCID WebID to potentially discover more information about entity (me). This is particularly useful as the ORCID WebID Profile is not completely open to add arbitrary information, but only a constrained set of information. For example, specifying a person's picture or their contacts is not currently possible with ORCID, however, if the alternative profiles (http://csarven.ca/#i) contain such information, they can be purposed to know more about the entity.</p>

              <p id="trust">Trust is ultimately tied to verifiable claims about identity and their provenance. While the creation and protection of third-party controlled online identities have received much focus, claiming and using personal identities online is still a challenge. Today's Web applications predominantly make use of online identities that are essentially tied to and controlled by authorities in which users are merely borrowing an identifier and its management. It is a common practice to where users are required to create accounts at each online service they wish to use, eg. social media sites. Moreover, the trust model of such design dictates claims and usage of online identities is not ultimately in the hands of the users, and can be taken away from the users by the owners of the URIs and service at any time and reason. Even in cases where third-party issues identities can be used across different services, it is subject to a privacy violation as the identity provider essentially gets to know which services the user's online identity is used with and for what purpose. Consequently such services can gradually build up information about users' actions as well as behavioural patterns on the Web. Lastly, portability and interoperability of the identities is generally under developed as there is no particular incentive for an identity provider to make it so - after all, providing "free" services for online identities, and then locking identities to well-defined circle of services is taken advantage of by large corporations given their business models. Perhaps most importantly, such online services (as well as applications) do not recognise the identity of users as a distinct notion from the applications and services they use towards authentication.</p>

              <p id="authentication-mechanisms">While there are different authentication mechanisms eg. <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617">The 'Basic' HTTP Authentication Scheme</a></cite>, service based authentication of centralised systems typically requiring a username and password, as well as being a typical re , <cite><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a></cite> (<abbr title="OpenID Connect">OIDC</abbr>), <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key credentials</a></cite>, in this thesis we will focus on digital certificates used by <a href="#tls">TLS</a>, ie. <a href="#x509">X.509 Certificate</a>.</p>

              <p id="web-of-trust"><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a></cite> (<abbr title="Web of Trust">WoT</abbr>) is a concept for a decentralised trust model used in systems like <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"><abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr></a></cite> to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. A public key cryptographic system uses a pair of keys: public keys (disseminated openly) and private keys (withheld by the owner). It has two main functions: authentication and encryption. For authentication, public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message. In the case of encryption, for example, when Guinan wants to send Picard a message, Guinan takes Picard's public key to encrypt a message where only Picard can decrypt the message with his private key. WoT essentially leaves trust decisions to the users, as opposed to a centralised authority. Thus, WoT uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestation of those certificates, eg. at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party">key signing parties</a>. Self-signing certificates removes the dependency on hierarchical certificate authorities to assert identity.</p>

              <p id="x509"><cite><a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en">X.509</a></cite> is a standard for public key certificates that specifies a structure for a digital certificate, including a public key associated with one or more identities, as well as extensions for new information. X.509 essentially serves as a identity card that can be used to store identity claims. X.509 certificates are used to authenticate servers and clients. Both TLS/SSL and <cite><a href="">HTTP Secure</a></cite> (<abbr title="HTTP Secure">HTTPS</abbr>) - an extension of HTTP for secure communication - use the <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280">Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile</a></cite>.</p>

              <p id="tls"><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">The Transport Layer Security Protocol Version 1.2</a></cite> (<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>) is a cryptographic protocol aimed at providing secure connections between applications. When applications eg. a server and a client (Web browser), communicate using the TLS protocol, it is private (secure) in that data is encrypted, identity of either party can be authenticated using public key cryptography (like PGP), and integrity of the exchanged data can be assured during transit.</p>

              <p id="webid-tls"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls">WebID-TLS</a></cite> defines how a server can authenticate a user with a client application holding the user's public key certificate, and serves towards identity claim verification. As the extension mechanism in X.509 allows additional statements to be specified under the <code>Subject Alternative Name</code> (<abbr title="Subject Alternative Name">SAN</abbr>) field, it is used to declare the user's WebID for the <code>URI</code> field. When a client application running on the Web browser requests a resource from the server, the TLS connection gets established between them. Once TLS has been set up, the HTTP application protocol exchange takes place (eg. <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>). If the requested resource requires WebID authentication (see also <a href="#authorization">authorization</a> policies) the server can request the client to authenticate itself. When the Web browser encounters this certificate request, it may prompt its user to choose a certificate (from its certificate manager) - thereby signing a token with its private key - to let the client send it to the server. The verification agent extracts the public key as well as the WebID from the certificate. As the WebID enables a global dereferencing mechanism for finding a key, the server uses can decide on dereferencing the WebID Profile and verify the claims about the WebID. Once the identity verification is established, the server can look up its access control rules for the requested resource to determine if and how the request can be fulfilled.</p>

              <p>There are a number of different ways to create a self-signed certificate which includes our WebID under SAN. Here we discuss a process that uses the <cite><a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a></cite> toolkit as outlined in: <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Foaf%2Bssl/HOWTO#How_to_create_a_certificate_which_includes_the_WebID_URI_for_multi-purpose_use">How to create a certificate which includes the WebID URI for multi-purpose use</a></cite>. We can create an RSA key that can be used to SSH to networks, include WebID URI and email information in the SAN to create an X.509 certificate which can be used to sign digitally sign emails, as well as to authenticate with from the Web browser. The <cite>Issuer Distinguished Name</cite> in X.509 (<code class="highlight-x509-issuer">Issuer</code> field) identifies the entity that signs the certificate, hence self-signing. The X.509 certificate and the private key can be bundled with the <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292">PKCS #12</a></cite> archive file format, and imported in Web browser's certificate manager. The certificate consists of information along the lines of:</p>

              <p id="webid-tls-delegation"><cite>WebID-TLS-Delegation</cite> is an an extension to WebID-TLS that enables users to delegate other agents to act on their behalf. In <cite><a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-905/TrampEtAl_COLD2012.pdf">Extending the WebID Protocol with Access Delegation</a></cite>, Sebastian Tramp et al, states how a <q>principal</q> agent can delegate authentication and access to a trusted <q>secretary</q> agent - typically a third-party software - who can act <em>on behalf of</em> of the principal agent to perform (asynchronous) requests. A secretary with its own WebID acting on behalf of a user can potentially have the same (or required) privileges while still being distinguishable eg. via different public key, and capabilities. An agent can declare a delegation as follows:</p>

              <figure class="listing">
                <pre><code>&lt;<span class="highlight-webid">http://csarven.ca/#i</span>&gt;</code>
<code>  acl:delegates &lt;https://example.org/application#i&gt; .</code></pre>
                <figcaption>An agent delegating another agent to act on its behalf.</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>whereas the agent making requests on behalf of another agent would include the HTTP <code>On-Behalf-Of</code> header when making requests.</p>

              <p>The WebID-TLS workflow is based on open standards, broadly supported across platforms (covering servers, desktops, notebooks, phones, and other <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> devices), saves bandwidth, has low latency, and is simple to implement. Another attractive area for users using their own WebIDs along with self-signed certificates is that users can abstain from creating accounts for each Web application they use, as well as remember and manage usernames and passwords which are often vulnerable to phishing. A user sign-in process to authenticate themselves is as simple as "clicking" a button. Similarly, the certificate selection processed can be bypassed in that user can instruct its Web browser to select a certificate automatically if a server makes an authentication request. This sort of automatic authentication is not necessarily desirable for all interaction cases, simply because the user may wish to remain anonymous.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, there are important challenges with the WebID-TLS approach. First, creating certificates (including safely handling of private keys) in Operating Systems and/or Web browsers, and making them available to Web applications is not well-known to users and lack "simple" tooling. Second, the user experience around certificate management and selection in Web browsers as well as in different devices has a lot of room for improvement. Third, in order to minimise security risks, essentially tying identity to a certificate generally means that users are tied to the device on which their certificate was created - although it is possible to export and import certificates across devices, the steps in between are considered to be potentially weak points of the chain. One way to securely port the certificate with its private key is by encrypting the PKCS #12 archive with <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">long and hard to guess</a> passphrases. In the event that the archive is stolen, there is at least a barrier which requires password cracking, and it may give sufficient time for the owner of the certificate to revoke it.</p>

              <p id="robust-links"><cite><a href="http://robustlinks.mementoweb.org/spec/">Robust Links</a></cite>: are human and machine-actionable approaches to <q>decorate</q> links in hypertext documents so that the context of linked resources is preserved at the time of linking. Given that content-drift and link-rot pose challenges to maintain context and integrity between resources in a long enough time line, associating the datetime information when linking helps to retain such context. The datetime information can be accompanied with a snapshot of the target URI made at a Web archive or a versioning system when linking, and using either the original or the versioned resource as the primary reference. Including datetime information in the source document can make it possible to interpret the context of each of the links in the document and to discover relevant snapshots. In the event that a linked resource or a snapshot becomes inaccessible, the datetime information helps to discover temporally close alternative snapshots.</p>

              <p class="todo">The relevance of this section/work is about independent publishing (different jurisdictions) but following same line of Web standards / interop... pay-as-you-go... the sum is greater</p>

              <p>This article describes the semantic structure and linking of the W3C Recommendation <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN), its test suite, and implementation reports.</p>

              <p>Semantically interlinking and detailed machine-readability of components related to Web standards and their implementations is novel, and can be useful for coherently documenting software projects and their conformance with specifications. Everything presented here is open source and reusable by other specifications (W3C standards or not), test suites, and implementations.</p>

              <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of this approach, the LDN test suite is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

              <p>The Web’s design stands out because of its absence of centralised control, both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience as well as a societal need for freedom of expression. A challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks is how related publications can be semantically interlinked, even if they are authored and published by different parties. Centralising their publications is practiced by the majority of authoring networks today, demanding authors to give up some or all of their control in exchange for technical simplicity.</p>

              <p>dokieli shows it is possible to build a social machine wherein people interact with each other without the need of centralised coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a decentralised authoring and annotation environment built with Web standards.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, dokieli’s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The social machine consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli’s functions and implement the principles to varying extents. Since the data is loosely coupled to the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of many current social platforms today.</p>

              <p>A couple of important socio-technical challenges remain. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as liking, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. While there is likely no final solution to these issues in an open ecosystem, it is worthwhile exploring within dokieli or other tools based on similar design principles.</p>

              <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers needs to be still solved.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>

              <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where "anyone can say anything about anything" is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication - independent to self-registration - must remain grounded on reproducible and/or replicable facts and explanations, attributable and accountable participants. After all, the output affects journalism, further scientific knowledge exchange, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>
